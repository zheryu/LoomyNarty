A simple console-based program that encodes a line of text into an existing image and extracts the text from the image. Can encode any text

## Encoding
1. Type 'encode' when prompted.
2. Insert your desired message in the next line. The message can be anything from 'message' to '好复杂！这个程序也可以编码中文！'
3. Type the file path of your input image. Index it from the C directory. e.g. 'C:\Users\my_user\image.png'
4. Type the file path of where you want to save the output image. e.g. 'C:\Users\my_user\output.png'

## Decoding
1. Type 'decode' when prompted.
2. Type the file path of your input image. Index it from the C directory. e.g. 'C:\Users\my_user\image.png'
3. View your text in the console

## Notes
- You might have to change your IDE's file encoding format settings to utf-8 to get this to work with all kinds of text.
- If the input image is not big enough, this program might not work correctly. Keep in mind, the current version is a prototype.
